It then reads in commands and executes them to an extent.
Rshell works with comments in the command line and also multple flags.

#BUGS

This program has a few bugs. It is not working when you input multiple commands. Rshell only works when you have one command with flags, e.g. "ls -a" , "ls -a1", etc.
